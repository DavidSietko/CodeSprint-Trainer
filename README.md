An interactive AI interview simulator designed to help you crack the tech interview. Built at 2025 Google Student AI Hackathon.

# How To Use:

1. clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Once cloned, navigate to the repo folder in the terminal and run the command: npm install. This will install all the necessary dependencies in order to run the project.
  - Make sure to have node installed to run this command.

3. Create a .env file within the repo and inside create a variable called GEMINI_API_KEY, set this to a google gemini api key. In order to get a gemini api key you need to create an account and register for an api key.

4. Once the api key is set and all the dependencies installed simply run npm run dev in order to see the project in your browser, you can run npm install without an api key but some features of the app will not work.
